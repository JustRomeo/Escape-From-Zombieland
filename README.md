# Escape-From-Zombieland

Version: 0.1<br/>
Last update: 25/11/2021

Come and try our game ! (The game is still under development)

### The game:
You can start a game from the Menu. Each game ends when your character dies. At the moment, the game has an endless level, with 3 types of Zombies appearing. These types of Zombies are characterized by their different appearances and characteristics:
- **Regular**: A basic zombie
- **Runner**: A fast zombie
- **Blower**: a Zombie that explodes near the player

The player can shoot these zombies in 4 different directions: up, right, down, and left. Zombies have random health points. These numbers of life points are more or less high depending on the type of Zombie.

The player can collect items. These items will either be used to increase statistics (such as precision or strength) or they will be stored in an inventory.

### The Options:
 The options are not modifiable at the moment. The game
 is playable with the keyboard or the controller (stable: Xbox type,    others are not guaranteed).
